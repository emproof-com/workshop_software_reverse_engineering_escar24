# Workshop: Software Reverse Engineering

This repository contains slides and materials for the Emproof workshop on software reverse engineering presented at [escar Europe 2024](https://escar.info/). The workshop covers the fundamentals of reverse engineering, tailored for a technical audience with minimal security experience. While the slides are available [here](./slides.pdf), the binaries for practical exercises are can be found in the [`samples`](./samples) folder. The solutions to the practical tasks can be found in the [recording of our webinar "Reverse Engineering: How Attackers Uncover Secrets in Binaries"](https://youtu.be/jdFTziF_wco), which is part of our [Emproof webinar series](https://github.com/emproof-com/webinars).

For more information, visit [Emproof](http://emproof.com). This workshop is designed and organized by [Tim Blazytko](https://github.com/mrphrazer/). For questions or further details, please reach out via the [Emproof contact form](https://www.emproof.com/contact/).
